# probability distribution

In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is the
mathematical function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of
different possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical
description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the
probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).

A probability distribution is a mathematical function that has a sample
space as its input, and gives a probability as its output.
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of a random
phenomenon being observed; it may be the set of real numbers or a set of
vectors, or it may be a list of non-numerical values. For example, the
sample space of a coin flip would be `{heads, tails}`.
